2. Siri @PCC
---------------------------------
Write a command line program which simulates a conversation between Me (your mentor) and your program. Please make it really hard for me to guess whether I'm chatting with a real person or computer program.

Should look something like...
```
➜  ~ ./hello_siri
➜  Hello. What's your name
Armen
➜  Armen?
Yeah Armen Babalu
➜  Oh hey Armen Babalu, how is your day?
Good, just finished teaching
➜  Oh I see. How is the weather?
It's summer, so pretty nice
...
```
